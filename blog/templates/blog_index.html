<!--

On line 7, we have the post title, which is a 
hyperlink. The link is a Django link where we are 
pointing to the URL named blog_detail, which takes 
an integer as its argument and should correspond to 
the pk value of the post.

Underneath the title, we’ll display the created_on 
attribute of the post as well as its categories. On 
line 11, we use another for loop to loop over all the 
categories assigned to the post.

On line 17, we use a template filter slice to cut off the 
post body at 400 characters so that the blog index is more readable.

Once that’s in place, you should be able to access this 
page by visiting localhost:8000/blog:
